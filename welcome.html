    <p>His early years were marked by the warmth of his rural surroundings and the love of his family.</p>
    
    <p>However, when Nicholas was in primary school, specifically in Grade 2, his parents' relationship took a turn.</p>
    
    <p>His mother made the difficult decision to divorce his father, leaving Nicholas and his father to face new challenges.</p>
    
    <p>With his mother starting a new life with another partner, Nicholas's father found himself in the role of a single parent, tasked with the responsibility of caring for his son.</p>
    
    <p>The sudden change in family dynamics was not easy, but Nicholas's father did his best to provide for him.</p>
    
    <p>During this time, Nicholas's grandmother stepped in to lend a helping hand.</p>

    <p>Despite the upheaval in his personal life, Nicholas remained focused on his education.</p>
    
    <p>He continued attending primary school, where his dedication and commitment to learning stood out.</p>
    
    <p>Teachers recall him as a diligent student, always eager to absorb knowledge and excel in his studies.</p>
    
    <p>One particular teacher who made a lasting impact on Nicholas's life was <em>Mr. Mutuku</em>, his English teacher.</p>
    
    <p>Mr. Mutuku's passion for teaching and his ability to inspire his students left a profound impression on Nicholas.</p>
    
    <p>He credits Mr. Mutuku for instilling in him a love for the English language and for shaping his academic journey.</p>
    
    <p>As Nicholas progressed through primary school, he faced various challenges, but his determination never wavered.</p>
    
    <p>However, in 2017, circumstances led to Nicholas having to terminate his primary school education prematurely.</p>
    
    <p>Despite this setback, Nicholas remains grateful for the lessons learned and the support received along the way.</p>
    
    <p>He fondly remembers Mr. Mutuku and expresses his gratitude, saying, <em>"Teacher, be blessed wherever you are. It is you who I am today."</em></p>
    
    <p>Nicholas's early experiences shaped his resilience and determination, laying the foundation for his future endeavors.</p>
    
    <p>His gratitude towards those who guided him reflects his humility and appreciation for the support that helped him overcome obstacles and pursue his dreams.</p>
